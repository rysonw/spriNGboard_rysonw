Unix vs DOS Text Files:
* DOS stands for Disk Operating System
* The main difference I noticed is how the lines are terminated in their respective file version
   * Unix uses a new line feed to indicate the end of a line
   * DOS uses a combo of a line feed with a carriage return to end a line


* Create a 1-line unix command that: (Using pipes, I can link all these commands together)
   * converts the original file from dos to Unix format
      * dos2unix words_alpha.txt
   * finds all 6-letter words starting with “i”
      * grep -E ‘\bi[a-z]{5}\b’ words_alpha.txt
   * replaces the word “intern” with your name
      * sed -i ‘s/intern/Ryson’ words_alpha.txt
   * replaces all occurrences of “z” with “-”
      * sed -i ‘s/z/-’ words_alpha.txt
   * arranges the words 5 per line
      * fold -w 5 -s words_alpha.txt
   * stores the result in a file
      * … > results.txt
   * RESULT: dos2unix words_alpha.txt && grep -E '\bi[a-z]{5}\b' words_alpha.txt | sed -i 's/intern/Ryson/g; s/z/-/g' words_alpha.txt | fold -w 5 -s > results.txt


* find all .xml files under /usr/ that don’t contain a number, “-” or “t”
  * Does not contain a number, “-” or “t”
      * ! -exec grep -q "[0-9-t]" {}
   ○ RESULT: find /usr/ -name "*.xml" ! -exec grep -q "[0-9-t]" {} \; -print

● modify your ~/.vimrc file to do something new
   ○ describe your change in a text file and upload it to your repo
