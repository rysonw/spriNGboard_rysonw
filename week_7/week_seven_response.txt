Changes:
- Overall:
	- Fixed the indenting on some functions
	- Added a lot of comments to describe the purpose of things
	- Removed some things from GameRunner that were not needed
	
- Game Class
   → Created a new class function called createQuestionString() which takes in a string and int to create the Science, Sports and Rock questions
   → There was two createRockQuestion() functions
   → Made is so that questions are only created through one function
   → Initlized a board and dictionary of question decks for ease of access in other functions

- roll()
   → There was some duplication so I removed chunk from the if (roll % 2) statement as it is repeated in the else statement
   → Added a modulo statement to track if we go over 12 spaces insteead of an if statement

- askQuestion()
   → Created a hashmap with the key being the category and the value being a ref to that respective deck
   → Save the current deck after a lookup

- currentCategory()
   → Used an array of categories and modulo magic to return the correct category

- wasCorrectlyAnswered()
   → Changed name to handleCorrectAnswer
   → Duplication so I changed to check for the unique case which is player is currently in the box and not getting out
   → Changed player reassignment statement to include modulo arithmetic, which allows us to turn it into a one-liner

- wrongAnswer()
   ⇒ Changed name to handleWrongAnswer
   ⇒ I think a logical suggestion would be combine this function with wasCorrectlyAnswered() but I think that would make the resulting function a little to verbose; better practice to keep it seperate
