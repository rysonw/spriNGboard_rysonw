Exercise 1: Corrent the spelling mistake
Starting with my refactored regression-tested code, fix the misspelled “corrent” with “correct”.  Adjust the regression test golden data accordingly.  Note any interesting observations.

Do this work on a branch named “exericise_1”, leaving the main branch intact.

Make sure the regression tests pass with your new code!

Notes: Was a simple fix, just commented out the line that declared the string correct. Ran a command to basically go through all files in golden_data and replace corrent with correct. Passed all test cases.

Exercise 2: Fix the penalty box logic
Starting with your code from Exercise 1, fix the penalty box logic.  Adjust the regression test golden data accordingly.  Note any interesting observations.  How confident are you in your fix?

Do this work on a branch named “exercise_2”, leaving the main and exercise_1 branches intact.

Notes: I noticed that the penalty box is 1-indexed. Since the penalty box has a capped sixe of 6, that means if somehow, all players were to be sent to the penalty box, there would be an overflow. Added a change where I create an int that calculates the size and add subtract one to get the 0-based index
